# Genre Detecting Neural Network (Lite)
A neural network that pulls information from a PostgreSQL database and determines whether a film is a drama or not depending on its title.

This is just a small learning project. I needed to learn how to create a neural network for a class and I also wanted to try out some PostgreSQL, so I thought why not both? My neural network uses the Pagila sample dataset stored within a PostgreSQL database, and after being trained by the dataset can predict whether or not a movie is a drama or not.

This is a simple binary classification, just to get a hands on for neural networks and it's also an experiment to see how to implement PostgreSQL in Python. Maybe one day I'll expand it if I feel like it.
